# Html-jQuery-website
In the site I showcase how jQuery can be implemented in a website 

### How to use the website.
1. To hide an image click on one of the images 
2. Click on the buttons to fade an image and stop fade to stop the image from fading
3. Hover over the Menu Option to see the menu list dropdown.
4. When clicking on the chaining method button the page will perform a jQuery Method Chaining.
